## Manuscript guidelines and submission information
Language: English or Chinese

Paper size : A4

Anonymous Submissions: We implement a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities of institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors' prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
